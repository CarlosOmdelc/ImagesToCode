# ImagesToCode
The idea behind this project is to automate the creation of wireframes.
A user will draw a wireframe and after inputting the design into the algorithm the code for the wireframe will be automatically generated.
In order to do this, I am using many wireframes that have been already coded into HTML and CSS files. I am not considering any framework, just normal HTML with Bootstrap.

This project is still under development.
